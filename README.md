# Password Generator
Password Generator is a command-line tool that generates secure and random passwords. The program offers four options for password generation: Default, Advanced, Custom Words, and Load Settings.

## Default
The Default option generates a password with 16 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Advanced
The Advanced option allows you to specify the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to include in the password. You can also remove any character types you don't want to include, and even specify the exact characters you want to include. Additionally, you can save these settings to a .txt file for future use.

## Custom Words
The Custom Words option allows you to specify a list of words to use in the password. The program will randomly select words from your list to create a password.

## Load Settings
The Load Settings option allows you to load a previously saved in .txt file to use for password generation. This option is useful if you have a specific set of settings that you frequently use.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Run the program
